# STUDY COMMON DESIGN PATTERNS

## 1. About this project
This project contains many sample codes for demonstrating the usage of the following design patterns:

- [x] [The Strategy Pattern](./01-strategy/README.md).
- [x] [The Observer Pattern](./02-observer/README.md).
- [x] [The Decorator Pattern](./03-decorator/README.md).
- [x] [The Factory Pattern](./04-factory/README.md).
- [x] [The Singleton Pattern](./05-singleton/README.md).
- [ ] The Command Pattern.
- [ ] The Adapter and Facade Patterns.
- [ ] The Template Method Pattern.
- [ ] The Iterator and Composite Patterns.
- [ ] The State Pattern.
- [ ] The Proxy Pattern.

## 2. Reference
- The problem in each module is from the book [Head First Design Patterns, 2nd Edition](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-design/9781492077992/) by Eric Freeman and Elisabeth Robson.
- The code in this project is referenced from that book.

## 3. Object-Oriented (OO) Design Principles

- Encapsulate what varies.
- Favor composition over inheritance.
- Program to interfaces, not implementations.
- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.
